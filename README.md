# Learning Blog Project
A simple blogging platform created as a learning exercise to understand web development concepts and modern tech stack implementation.
Overview
This is an intentionally simplified blogging website with limited functionality, developed primarily as a learning project. The project follows a monorepo structure with separate backend, frontend, and common shared modules.
## Project Structure
### Backend
Node.js backend with Prisma ORM
Basic API endpoints for blog operations
Minimal authentication system
### Frontend
Built with Vite
Styled using Tailwind CSS
Basic blog post viewing and creation interface
## Current Limitations
Limited user management
Basic CRUD operations only
Minimal error handling
No advanced features like comments or categories
Simplified authentication
## Purpose
This project serves as a hands-on learning experience for:
Full-stack development workflow
TypeScript implementation
Database operations with Prisma
Frontend development with modern tools
Project structure and organization
## Getting Started
Clone the repository
Install dependencies in all directories:
```bash
cd backend && npm install
cd ../frontend && npm install
cd ../common && npm install
```
Set up your environment variables
Run the development servers
# Note
This is a work in progress and intentionally lacks many features you would expect in a production blogging platform. The focus is on learning and understanding core concepts rather than building a fully-featured application.
